  - Jakob Nielsen makes an in-depth analysis of why usability is often overlooked in Software Engineering, and why it ought to be taken more seriously. Then, he offers quality advice on how to improve usability in different interfaces, and presents various design and testing techniques. Amongst these, the 10 usability heuristics are perhaps the most studied and utilised.

  - Khamaj, et al. surveyed a focus group of undergraduate students ranging from 18  to 47 years old about weather app design patterns and usability. The survey included 9 questions about their preferences, past experiences, and general opinions about certain design elements in weather apps. Using thematic analysis, four major themes were identified in the participants' responses. These themes were: *User Cognitive Load*, *Effectiveness*, *Efficiency of Use*, and *User Perceptions*. Participants concurred in making features easily reachable, through effective signalling and labelling. Several participants argued that information should be easily digestible, without technical jargon, and concise enough to comfortably fit in the screen. Flexibility in the ways to accomplish a task was a desired feature by many. For the most part, the findings were found to align with Nielsen's heuristics. The final three recommendations were to target alert messages to the end users, enhancing location search, and prioritise fast and intuitive access to weather forecasts.

  - College students (n = 308) from three different universities in the United States participated on a survey containing 28 items. These items gathered information about the participant's demographic information, their preferred sources for weather forecasts in general and opinions regarding these. Furthermore, the survey also inquired about the subject's use of smartphones and weather apps, as well as their perception of specific elements from a forecast. Mobile weather apps were by far the most frequently used source of weather data amongst the participants. Participants who reported having switched from the default weather app cited reasons such as "more information and details, ease of
    use, understandability, and graphics". When it comes to specific elements of a weather forecast, the elements which participants selected as the most important were, in order, the hourly forecast, chance of precipitation, current information, severe weather alerts, and the 5-day forecast. Suggested improvements to existing weather apps centered around better information, better design and customisation, and improved accuracy.
